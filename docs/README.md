# Kubestr

Kubestr is a tool that qualifies the storage options present in a cluster.  
In upcoming releases we plan to suport running an FIO test on the storage as well as testing the snapshotting capabilities of a storage provisioner.

To run the tool -  
`curl https://kastenhq.github.io/kubestr/run_kubestr.sh | bash`
